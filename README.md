#Problem:

A furniture manufacturing company has its showrooms in multiple districts. Manufacturing of furniture takes place in Moratuwa and finished goods are delivered from the factory directly to the customerâ€™s site. The head office is also in Moratuwa on the same site as the factory. The customers visit showrooms and go through the available furniture. In order to purchase, the customer has to order furniture which will then be delivered from the factory. Furniture available on stock is delivered within three days and others are manufactured and delivered within one month. The company is to design a database to keep track of all these functions such as sales at each showroom, company stock details, manufacturing orders and their delivery status up to date.
